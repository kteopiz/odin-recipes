        until the liquid is abosrbed and a sticky dough ball has formed. Rub the dough surface 
        lightly with olive oil. Let sit for at least 12 hours up to three days covered and refrigerated

        Line a 9x13 baking tray with parchment paper, or grease with butter, or coat with nonstick 
        cooking spray.

        Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F, if using rosemary
        sprinkle all over the dough and pour another table spoon of oil over the dough.
    </li>
    <li>Lightly oil your hands and press holes into the surface of the dough and flatten it
        to spread it across the entire baking tray. Ensure it covers the surface of the pan and
        has lots of dimples. Sprinkle salt over the now flattened dough
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until the underside is golden and crisp
        Once finished transfer the focaccia to a colling rack and let cool for 10 minutes
